##### **Plenary 5: Artificial Intelligence – Managing Risks and Leveraging Opportunities**

**Prof Simon CHESTERMAN**
<br>  Senior Director, AI Governance, AI Singapore
<br>  Professor, National University of Singapore (NUS) College, NUS

There are, now, hundreds of guides, frameworks, and principles intended to make AI “ethical” or “responsible”. Nevertheless, ever more powerful applications continue to be released ever more quickly. Safety and security teams are being downsized or sidelined to bring AI products to market. And a significant portion of AI developers apparently believe there is a real risk that their work poses an existential threat to humanity.

The tragedy of AI governance is that those with the greatest leverage to regulate AI have the least interest in doing so, while those with the greatest interest have the least leverage.

Resolving these challenges may require rethinking the incentive structures — or waiting for a crisis that brings the need for regulation and coordination into sharper focus.
