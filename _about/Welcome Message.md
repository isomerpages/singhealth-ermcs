I am happy and honoured to welcome all distinguished guests and delegates to the inaugural Enterprise Risk Management Congress (ERMCS) that will be held at the Conrad Centennial Singapore from 27 to 28 June 2023.

In 2009, SingHealth pioneered the implementation of Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) on a Cluster-wide level in Singapore. Since then, SingHealth ERM Programme, Culture and Community have grown steadily throughout the years. Globally, ERM has gained traction and grown to be a preferred risk management approach for many industries including aviation, construction and public health.

Through this year’s theme, “Building Resiliency through ERM”, ERMCS 2023 aims to take stock of the myriad of current and emerging risks in various domains and underscore the urgency to remain resilient and adaptive in the face of unparalleled and/or impending risks in this Vulnerable, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous (VUCA) world.

This Congress has brought together a diverse group of like-minded ERM leaders and professionals to share their ERM insights, and valuable experiences. The advantage of such a diverse variety of presentations is that delegates may learn from experts that are beyond their field of practice.This year, we are also calling for abstract submission for the ERMCS Poster Competition. The Poster Competition is open to all ERM Professionals across industries and we hope to receive your entries for the Poster Competition soon.

The Congress Organising Committee and I look forward to warmly welcoming you to this exciting event and to meeting all of you in person in June 2023 in Singapore.

Best Regards

Associate Professor Ong Biauw Chi

Group Chief Risk Officer, SingHealth
