> ####  "Building Resiliency through ERM"

   

The **inaugural Enterprise Risk Management Congress Singapore 2023**, organised by the SingHealth Office of Risk Services, will bring together **like-minded ERM leaders and professionals** to share their ERM insights, expert advice and experiences in their expertise areas. ERMCS will seek to take stock of the myriad of current and emerging risks in various domains and underscore the urgency to remain resilient and adaptive in the face of unparalleled and/or impending risks in this VUCA world.

**Enterprise Risk Management begins at the heart of everything.** As disruptive events and global forces continue to shape and change the way organisations operate, it is **imperative to reimagine the way organisations manage risks and strengthen their resiliency** during uncertain times. In an organisation, **E**veryone is truly a **R**isk **M**anager.

ERMCS hopes to provide a **platform for a constructive nexus** amongst ERM leaders and practitioners alike, **grow Singaporeâ€™s local ERM community and culture** as well as **inspire collaborations and contributions in the realm of ERM**. The positive impact from the collective learning and sharing will percolate across SingHealth and various industries in Singapore.

Risk Management Professionals from various industries as well as key partners from the public and private sectors in Singapore and Regional Countries are expected to attend the Congress.
