<p><strong>Dear Esteemed Guests,</strong>
</p>
<p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the <strong>Enterprise Risk Management Congress (ERMCS) 2025</strong>,
held once again in the vibrant city of Singapore. This year’s Congress
is not only a continuation of a proud tradition but also a pivotal platform
to advance how we think about and practice risk management in an ever-changing
world.</p>
<p>Since the launch of SingHealth’s Cluster-wide Enterprise Risk Management
(ERM) Programme in 2009, we have witnessed a maturing ecosystem of risk
professionals — united by a shared commitment to safeguarding our institutions,
systems, and communities. As risk environments evolve, so must our strategies.
ERM has grown beyond a compliance function — it is now a driver of strategic
foresight, operat</p>
<p>ional resilience, and innovation across industries.</p>
<p>As we navigate a world marked by climate shifts, digital disruption, global
health challenges, and rapid AI adoption, we can no longer afford to manage
risk in silos. This Congress brings together thought leaders and practitioners
from healthcare, finance, education, technology, social, hospitality, and
the public sector to explore how cross-sector insights can shape more adaptive,
integrated approaches to risk.</p>
<p>Over the two days, you will hear from distinguished speakers, engage in
rich discussions, and gain exposure to innovative frameworks through the <strong>ERM Poster Competition and Exhibition</strong>.
These opportunities are more than academic — they are collaborative springboards
to help each of us build systems that are not only risk-aware but future-ready.</p>
<p>I encourage you to take full advantage of this Congress: ask bold questions,
share your experiences, and build networks that extend beyond the Congress.
It is through these conversations that we shape a more resilient and agile
future.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of ERMCS 2025. We look forward to connecting
with you and learning together as we continue to grow collectively as a
community in enterprise risk management.</p>
<p><strong>Warm regards,</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Professor Ong Biauw Chi</strong>
