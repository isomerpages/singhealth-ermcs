<p><strong>Dear Esteemed Guests,</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>It is my great pleasure to welcome you to the <strong>Enterprise Risk Management Congress (ERMCS) 2025</strong>,
held once again in the vibrant city of Singapore. This year’s Congress
is not only a continuation of a proud tradition but also a pivotal platform
to advance how we think about and practice risk management in an ever-changing
world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since the launch of SingHealth’s Cluster-wide Enterprise Risk Management
(ERM) Programme in 2009, we have witnessed a maturing ecosystem of risk
professionals — united by a shared commitment to safeguarding our institutions,
systems, and communities. As risk environments evolve, so must our strategies.
ERM has grown beyond a compliance function — it is now a driver of strategic
foresight, operational resilience, and innovation across industries.</p>
