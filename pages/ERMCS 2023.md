###### **Plenary 1: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)**

##### ***Risk Management and ESG***
The presentation aim to share with the delegates on the how the ERM has evolved with the introduction of ESG risks. These include strategic risks and operational risks in relation to the Healthcare ecosystem.

This will include the incorporation of ESG in the risk management exercise for health care service providers.
<hr>


##### ***How to manage ESG risk in the People sector***
Recently, the Charity Council has announced that ESG will be incorporated into the Code of Governance. As a result, ESG awareness within the People sector has been increasing rapidly. However, while many understand what ESG will look like for the People sector, many more may not fully understand the risks of engaging in ESG. What are these risks? How can the People sector manage these risks? What are some tools that People sector organisations can use for ESG risk management? Prof Ang Hak Seng’s presentation will bring clarity on how ESG
risk can be managed in the People sector.
<hr>


##### ***Panel Discussion: From ESG to R(esilience)***
   

The general theme of the Panel discussion will seek to address areas such as ESG risks, Strategic Risks and Overall Operational Risks in relation to the Healthcare ecosystem. This will include perspectives in relation to public, private service providers, service intermediaries and community health care service providers.

<hr>   

###### **Plenary 2: Crisis &amp; Risk Communications**


##### ***Crisis Ready, Media Savvy Part 1 – A Practical Approach for High Stakes Situation***
In today's world where bad news can go viral in mere seconds, organisations must be fast and ready to react in a crisis. To protect its reputation and survival, a company needs to shape and manage public perception the moment an emergency erupts

Knowing the right thing to say, while showing empathy, comes with proper guidance, preparation and practice. CEOs and spokespersons can no longer hide behind press statements. Due to the rampant nature of social media, a wrong word or gesture can create even more chaos and confusion.

Join Hwee Yin and Rebecca, two former broadcast journalists from Channel NewsAsia, in a special two-part presentation - "Crisis Ready, Media Savvy". For their afternoon session, acquire the right mindset and muscle to protect the company's reputation. Pick up practical tips to stay calm under pressure with the help of the 4 "S" Framework - System, Simulation, Spokesperson &amp; Sensitivity.

Then for the evening session (Crisis Ready, Media Savvy Part 2 at 5pm), it's Lights, Camera and Action!

Research shows that your likability factor matters much more on screen.

People are more likely to switch off, if they find your appearance jarring or distracting or simply because they dislike the sound of your voice. From lighting to camera angle and microphone, you need to think like a TV producer to frame your best shot, so as to look and sound good for media interviews in high stakes situations.
<hr>


##### ***Getting Risk Communication Right***
Groups of individuals can hold very different perceptions of risk from each other, and there are sometimes wide gaps between individuals’ risk perceptions and expert risk assessments. These gaps make risk management actions harder to implement and at worst lead to conflict within organisations or across society, as many incidents during the Covid pandemic illustrated.

Insights from the fields of psychology and decision-making help explain why perceptions of risk diverge. By drawing on this knowledge base, we can design more effective risk communications strategies, using methods of engagement and forms of communication which build trust.

The first step in communicating risk effectively is to understand the values, concerns and perceptions of stakeholder groups. The presentation will provide a snapshot of risk perceptions on key issues from recent surveys and consider how organisations can monitor the pulse of stakeholders when it comes to key risks. A central recommendation is to work in peaceful times to ensure that risk communications are more effective when a crisis hits.
<hr>

###### **Plenary 3: Healthcare Enterprise Risk Management**


##### ***Clinical Risk Management – A Cornerstone in Healthcare ERM***
<hr>


##### ***Healthcare Enterprise Risk Management - The Insurance Market Perspective***

<hr>

##### **Special Session: Crisis Ready, Media Savvy Part 2**


*Lights, Camera and Action!*

Research shows that your likability factor matters much more on screen.

People are more likely to switch off, if they find your appearance jarring or distracting or simply because they dislike the sound of your voice. From lighting to camera angle and microphone, you need to think like a TV producer to frame your best shot, so as to look and sound good for media interviews in high stakes situations.

###### **Plenary 4: Human Capital and Employee Wellness**

##### ***Remaining Resilient in the Social Service Sector through Human Capital Risk Management***
   

Evolving economic, social, and demographic trends have increased demands for quantity and quality of social service in Singapore. However, limited resources coupled with the specialised, yet taxing nature of social service professions pose constant challenges to recruiting and retaining the talent required to meet these increasing demands.

To enhance services and social impact, the Social Service Sector must first improve human capital management. Establishing equitable remuneration, continuous capability development and employee welfare are key to sustaining a sector workforce ready to take on future challenges to achieve social impact.

By leveraging on innovative solutioning, digitalisation and the multitude of stakeholders present in the sector, Social Service Agencies (SSAs) have vast potential to expand resources and develop business acumen to improve problem-solving capacity and service delivery efficiency. SSAs should also utilise the slew of support programmes and resources provided by the National Council of Social Service to aid in their human resource development, to remain resilient in this VUCA world.

<hr>


##### ***Engaging (M.E.) - (M)otivation and (E)xpectations of a worker in a post COVID world***
Engagement is a significant issue in the workforce. The factors affecting engagement is framed in the broader context of work-culture. The presentation aims to highlight the (M)otivations &amp; (E)xpectations of a worker in a post-COVID world, mitigating risks related to work culture by increasing employee engagement, motivation &amp; productivity, which will be of great interest and benefit to the delegates.
<hr>

###### **Plenary 5: Break-Out Session 1**
###### **Track A: Education in ERM**


##### ***Cultivating a Risk-Aware Culture through ERM-ducation***

Cultivating a risk-aware culture is crucial for organisations to manage and mitigate potential risks and uncertainties effectively. As the global risk landscape evolves in tandem with the every-changing environment, ERM becomes increasingly important in creating value for the organisation. By equipping and empowering employees with essential knowledge and training on proactive risk identification, assessment, evaluation and response, organisations can leverage on their human capital to identify and address pertinent or emerging risks in a coordinated manner.

This plenary session will share some of the benefits of ERM education, how organisations can leverage on the ERM communications and stakeholder engagement to bridge the gap in ERM literacy as well as cover some of the strategies that SingHealth takes to build a risk-aware culture amongst staff, ERM Leads and ERM practitioners in the organisation.&nbsp; We will also explore a bit about the need for ERM training in education practitioners.
<hr>

###### **Track B: Global Supply Chain Management**


##### ***Risk Management across the end-to-end supply chain using exponential technology***
   

A lot of traditional supply chain planning and execution has happened by analysis of historical performance, and whilst there have been advanced statistical models to forecast demand based on historical performance, there is more of a need now to use external data from events monitoring or sentiment analysis to enrich the planning and be able to respond more rapidly to volatility in demand and supply.&nbsp;&nbsp;

End to end supply chain processes are moving to more dynamic processes, to enable a proactive response rather than a reactive one. One of the key criteria is to harness both internal and external data to advance the supply chain resilience and agility. Whilst data and technology are key ingredients, supply chain practitioners need to embrace new ways of working.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

Let's look at various risk factors that impact the various nodes of the supply chain, and how to understand and have visibility into these risk factors to be able to respond to them.&nbsp;

Various technologies enable Supply Chain optimization such as demand forecasting, supply planning and inventory optimization. Let’s look at some examples of how we embed risk factors into the end to end Supply Chain and leverage AI and ML, simulation models and predictive analytics to manage supply chain risk.
<hr>

###### **Plenary 6: Break-Out Session 2**
###### **Track C: Cyber Risk and Internet of Things (IoT)**


##### ***A Proactive Strategy in Risk Management – Medical Device Risk Profiling***
The increasing adoption of integrated devices and systems in healthcare has brought about an upward trajectory of incidents and adverse events. Due to the complexity of medical devices in its operation as well as the working environment in the healthcare setting, management of medical device risks should encompass various factors such as device application, level of integration, cybersecurity risks, user-derived risks, as well as the potential impact within the healthcare setting. These factors could be assessed by developing a Medical Device Risk Profile to determine the enterprise risk level of a medical device from a comprehensive view.
<hr>


##### ***IoT Hazards – Are Hospitals Prepared***
The safe use of health technology—from simple devices to complex information systems—necessitates identifying possible sources of danger or difficulty with those technologies and taking steps to minimize the risk that adverse events will occur. This is especially important as the cradle-to-grave management of medical equipment becomes more complex with medical devices being more interconnected. This session will highlight technology safety topics related to the Internet of Medical Things that we believe warrant great attention.
<hr>

###### **Track D: Charting a New Course for Resilience in the Finance &amp; Insurance Arena**

##### ***New Frontier of Risk &amp; Resilience***
<hr>


##### ***Bringing Risk Culture to the Next Level***
A refreshing approach to build a stronger Risk Culture through exploring individual risk propensities, collaborating innovatively and looking at Risk Culture from a different lens.
<hr>

###### **Plenary 7: Innovation &amp; Research**


##### ***Building Resilience in Clinical Research Post COVID***
The clinical research ecosystem is facing major drivers (post covid-19 pandemic and ability to utilise large datasets) for future innovation, causing the stakeholders to re-evaluate the approach to medical product development. In order for us to be competitive in the global research landscape, the Singapore research ecosystem will need to look at how to institutionalise innovation while mitigating the associated risks. Areas where Singapore can make a difference includes harnessing big data from diverse sources and use of advanced analytics, optimising the use of digital healthcare solutions, closing the gap in translational medicine. The various stakeholders should be equipped to adapt to these innovations and stay ahead of the ever-changing research landscape.



##### ***Innovation in Cybersecurity: Empowering Proactive Defense and Resilience***
Enhancing cyber-defenses is a fundamental aspect of innovation in cybersecurity. Traditional security measures that used to work may no longer suffice against sophisticated attacks. Through innovation, organizations can implement cutting-edge technologies to proactively adapt to ever-evolving cyber-attacks.

Advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and behavioral analytics enable real-time threat detection and response. These innovative approaches empower organizations to identify and mitigate potential cyber-attacks to safeguard sensitive information and secure digital assets.

Gain valuable insights from Pauline Tan's talk as she highlights the crucial role of continuous innovation in enabling organizations to uphold a proactive approach in implementing cybersecurity measures and cultivating cyber resilience.
<hr>

###### **Closing Plenary: Resilience for the Future**

##### ***A Resilient Organisation - What we can do to prepare for the Future***
Current events, such as the recent banking turmoil coupled with Russia’s ongoing conflict with Ukraine, have led to macroeconomic challenges such as high inflation, potential risk of financial instability, and disruptions in the global supply chain. These are happening against the backdrop of climate change and other environmental challenges, as well as fast-moving technological innovations in automation and artificial intelligence, which are transforming the way we work and live. Organisations therefore need to be always on, always vigilant, and always adapting to potential disruptive events and trends.

Ms Koh will be sharing her experiences and insights on what organisations can do to be more prepared, and how having oversight of enterprise risks can help organisations better deal with potential new and emerging risks. All of this can help organisations to foster resiliency amidst this uncertain and future global risk landscape.
