##### ***How to manage ESG risk in the People sector***
Recently, the Charity Council has announced that ESG will be incorporated into the Code of Governance. As a result, ESG awareness within the People sector has been increasing rapidly. However, while many understand what ESG will look like for the People sector, many more may not fully understand the risks of engaging in ESG. What are these risks? How can the People sector manage these risks? What are some tools that People sector organisations can use for ESG risk management? Prof Ang Hak Seng’s presentation will bring clarity on how ESG
risk can be managed in the People sector.

##### ***Crisis Ready, Media Savvy Part 1 – A Practical Approach for High Stakes Situation***
In today's world where bad news can go viral in mere seconds, organisations must be fast and ready to react in a crisis. To protect its reputation and survival, a company needs to shape and manage public perception the moment an emergency erupts

Knowing the right thing to say, while showing empathy, comes with proper guidance, preparation and practice. CEOs and spokespersons can no longer hide behind press statements. Due to the rampant nature of social media, a wrong word or gesture can create even more chaos and confusion.

Join Hwee Yin and Rebecca, two former broadcast journalists from Channel NewsAsia, in a special two-part presentation - "Crisis Ready, Media Savvy". For their afternoon session, acquire the right mindset and muscle to protect the company's reputation. Pick up practical tips to stay calm under pressure with the help of the 4 "S" Framework - System, Simulation, Spokesperson &amp; Sensitivity.

Then for the evening session (Crisis Ready, Media Savvy Part 2 at 5pm), it's Lights, Camera and Action!

Research shows that your likability factor matters much more on screen.

People are more likely to switch off, if they find your appearance jarring or distracting or simply because they dislike the sound of your voice. From lighting to camera angle and microphone, you need to think like a TV producer to frame your best shot, so as to look and sound good for media interviews in high stakes situations.

##### ***Getting Risk Communication Right***
Groups of individuals can hold very different perceptions of risk from each other, and there are sometimes wide gaps between individuals’ risk perceptions and expert risk assessments. These gaps make risk management actions harder to implement and at worst lead to conflict within organisations or across society, as many incidents during the Covid pandemic illustrated.

Insights from the fields of psychology and decision-making help explain why perceptions of risk diverge. By drawing on this knowledge base, we can design more effective risk communications strategies, using methods of engagement and forms of communication which build trust.

The first step in communicating risk effectively is to understand the values, concerns and perceptions of stakeholder groups. The presentation will provide a snapshot of risk perceptions on key issues from recent surveys and consider how organisations can monitor the pulse of stakeholders when it comes to key risks. A central recommendation is to work in peaceful times to ensure that risk communications are more effective when a crisis hits.
