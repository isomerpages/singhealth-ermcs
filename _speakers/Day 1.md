###### ***Session Title: How to manage ESG risk in the People sector***
   

Recently, the Charity Council has announced that ESG will be incorporated into the Code of Governance. As a result, ESG awareness within the People sector has been increasing rapidly. However, while many understand what ESG will look like for the People sector, many more may not fully understand the risks of engaging in ESG. What are these risks? How can the People sector manage these risks? What are some tools that People sector organisations can use for ESG risk management? Prof Ang Hak Sengâ€™s presentation will bring clarity on how ESG
risk can be managed in the People sector.
