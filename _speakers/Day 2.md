Systems Developer, Academic Researcher, Computer Engineer, User Experience Designer, Weiquan wears many hats. In his current role as Assistant Professor at Duke-NUS Medical School, Weiquan develops Immersive Technology solutions (such as Artificial Intelligence, Augmented and Virtual Reality Simulations) for improving patient outcomes, enhancing student learning and safeguarding educator sanity. His research interests include figuring out if, how and why all this technology tangibly and measurably affects human learning. In his past life, Weiquan worked closely with the aviation industry to develop next-generation immersive pilot training systems. His award-winning solutions have (probably!) helped change the world for the better (or so he hopes!). He even runs courses to teach others to (hopefully!) do the same.
