Cherilyn founded Tessaract Technologies in 2018 when she identified a lack of tools available to help professionals work efficiently. Cherilyn is driven by her quest to connect people and businesses across Asia with reliable systems so that they can work quickly and efficiently in order to make better decisions and build stronger businesses. Tessaract was founded to empower professional services firms by digitalising their operations and introducing them to new technologies such as artificial intelligence and data analytics. Cherilyn is also the founder of Asia Law Network, Asiaâ€™s largest network of lawyers and has launched various products such as a lawyer-vetted legal blog, Quick Consult and Quick Contracts, to name a few. Prior to this, she was instrumental in turning around a creative agency and led multiple design thinking projects. She has a proven track record of excellent business implementation and drives strategic direction and technology and product development at Tessaract. Cherilyn has raised a total of 6.3M USD from angels and VCs such as Wavemaker Partners, CIMA Capital Partners and M Venture Partners, and has grown Tessaract Technologies into the UK and EMEA, leading the cloud-native solutions adoption in the industry alongside complementary companies such as Reynan Court.
