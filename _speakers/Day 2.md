##### ***Remaining Resilient in the Social Service Sector through Human Capital Risk Management***
   

Evolving economic, social, and demographic trends have increased demands for quantity and quality of social service in Singapore. However, limited resources coupled with the specialised, yet taxing nature of social service professions pose constant challenges to recruiting and retaining the talent required to meet these increasing demands.

To enhance services and social impact, the Social Service Sector must first improve human capital management. Establishing equitable remuneration, continuous capability development and employee welfare are key to sustaining a sector workforce ready to take on future challenges to achieve social impact.

By leveraging on innovative solutioning, digitalisation and the multitude of stakeholders present in the sector, Social Service Agencies (SSAs) have vast potential to expand resources and develop business acumen to improve problem-solving capacity and service delivery efficiency. SSAs should also utilise the slew of support programmes and resources provided by the National Council of Social Service to aid in their human resource development, to remain resilient in this VUCA world.

##### ***A Proactive Strategy in Risk Management – Medical Device Risk Profiling***
The increasing adoption of integrated devices and systems in healthcare has brought about an upward trajectory of incidents and adverse events. Due to the complexity of medical devices in its operation as well as the working environment in the healthcare setting, management of medical device risks should encompass various factors such as device application, level of integration, cybersecurity risks, user-derived risks, as well as the potential impact within the healthcare setting. These factors could be assessed by developing a Medical Device Risk Profile to determine the enterprise risk level of a medical device from a comprehensive view.

##### ***IoT Hazards – Are Hospitals Prepared***
The safe use of health technology—from simple devices to complex information systems—necessitates identifying possible sources of danger or difficulty with those technologies and taking steps to minimize the risk that adverse events will occur. This is especially important as the cradle-to-grave management of medical equipment becomes more complex with medical devices being more interconnected. This session will highlight technology safety topics related to the Internet of Medical Things that we believe warrant great attention.

##### ***Building Resilience in Clinical Research Post COVID***
The clinical research ecosystem is facing major drivers (post covid-19 pandemic and ability to utilise large datasets) for future innovation, causing the stakeholders to re-evaluate the approach to medical product development. In order for us to be competitive in the global research landscape, the Singapore research ecosystem will need to look at how to institutionalise innovation while mitigating the associated risks. Areas where Singapore can make a difference includes harnessing big data from diverse sources and use of advanced analytics, optimising the use of digital healthcare solutions, closing the gap in translational medicine. The various stakeholders should be equipped to adapt to these innovations and stay ahead of the ever-changing research landscape.

##### ***Innovation in Cybersecurity: Empowering Proactive Defense and Resilience***
Enhancing cyber-defenses is a fundamental aspect of innovation in cybersecurity. Traditional security measures that used to work may no longer suffice against sophisticated attacks. Through innovation, organizations can implement cutting-edge technologies to proactively adapt to ever-evolving cyber-attacks.

Advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and behavioral analytics enable real-time threat detection and response. These innovative approaches empower organizations to identify and mitigate potential cyber-attacks to safeguard sensitive information and secure digital assets.

Gain valuable insights from Pauline Tan's talk as she highlights the crucial role of continuous innovation in enabling organizations to uphold a proactive approach in implementing cybersecurity measures and cultivating cyber resilience.

##### ***A Resilient Organisation - What we can do to prepare for the Future***
Current events, such as the recent banking turmoil coupled with Russia’s ongoing conflict with Ukraine, have led to macroeconomic challenges such as high inflation, potential risk of financial instability, and disruptions in the global supply chain. These are happening against the backdrop of climate change and other environmental challenges, as well as fast-moving technological innovations in automation and artificial intelligence, which are transforming the way we work and live. Organisations therefore need to be always on, always vigilant, and always adapting to potential disruptive events and trends.

Ms Koh will be sharing her experiences and insights on what organisations can do to be more prepared, and how having oversight of enterprise risks can help organisations better deal with potential new and emerging risks. All of this can help organisations to foster resiliency amidst this uncertain and future global risk landscape.
