<p><strong>Plenary 9: Risk-Ready: Navigating the Risk and Resilience Journey</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Mr Derek Taylor</strong>
</p>
<p>Managing Director, Strategic Risk Consulting, Marsh</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>
</p>
<p>In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, organizations face a multitude
of risks that can disrupt operations and threaten their long-term viability.
The COVID-19 pandemic is just one example that has underscored the critical
importance of both risk management and resilience in any organization.</p>
<p>This presentation will explore the synergies between enterprise risk,
business continuity and crisis management, exploring how these disciplines
can work together to enhance an organization's ability to navigate crises
and build resilience. We will discuss the key components of these risk
and resilience frameworks, highlighting their shared objectives and complementary
approaches.</p>
<p>Through activities and case studies, we will showcase how organizations
have successfully integrated enterprise risk management (ERM) to effectively
address risks proactively, while also leveraging business continuity management
(BCM) and crisis management (CM) to ensure preparedness for potential incidents
and scenarios. These will highlight the practical benefits of aligning
these disciplines and demonstrate how they can collectively strengthen
an organization's ability to be risk-ready.</p>
<p>By attending this presentation, participants will be able to gain insights
into the key success factors of implementing effective ERM, BCM, and CM
frameworks, and learn how this integration can bolster an organization's
proactive risk and resilience efforts, ensure preparedness for potential
incidents, and ultimately foster long-term resilience in the face of evolving
challenges.</p>
