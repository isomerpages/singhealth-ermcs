**Mr Faris ISKANDAR**

In his speech on managing risk in aviation, Mr Iskandar will emphasise the critical importance of risk management not only within the aviation industry but also across various other sectors.

He will bring us through risk management key elements, which include Safety Culture, Communication &amp; Collaboration and Technology &amp; Innovation.

##### **Plenary 7: Your 3rd Party Suppliers Should Not Be Your Weakest Link**

**Mr HOI Wai Khin**
<br>
Partner, Technology Consulting, RSM Singapore
  
In the digital age, outsourcing enhances the backbone of organizational operations, providing critical hardware, software, and services that underpin digital infrastructure. However, when the weakest link in the chain is the 3rd party vendors, it exposes businesses to a spectrum of risks and vulnerabilities. This session delves into the intricacies of 3rd party supplier dependencies within organisational frameworks, examining the origins, consequences, and strategies for mitigating vulnerabilities.
