##### **Plenary 2: Mitigating Clinical Risks through Enhanced Surgical Safety**

**A/Prof TAN Hiang Khoon**
<br>
Deputy Chief Executive Officer (Future Health System), Singapore General Hospital (SGH)<br>
Senior Consultant, Division of Surgery &amp; Surgical Oncology, SGH &amp; National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS)<br>
Group Director, International Collaboration Office, SingHealth

Clinical risk management in surgical settings is crucial, with data indicating that 30% of surgical deaths are preventable. A comprehensive strategy is essential for mitigating these risks, involving stringent privileging standards, harmonized care practices, advanced technological integration, and patient engagement. 

A multi-faceted approach combines meticulous data monitoring, standardised practices, and patient involvement. By integrating these strategies, healthcare systems can better manage clinical risks and achieve optimal patient outcomes.

##### **Plenary 5: Artificial Intelligence – Managing Risks and Leveraging Opportunities**

**Prof Simon CHESTERMAN**
<br>  Senior Director, AI Governance, AI Singapore
<br>  Professor, National University of Singapore (NUS) College, NUS

There are, now, hundreds of guides, frameworks, and principles intended to make AI “ethical” or “responsible”. Nevertheless, ever more powerful applications continue to be released ever more quickly. Safety and security teams are being downsized or sidelined to bring AI products to market. And a significant portion of AI developers apparently believe there is a real risk that their work poses an existential threat to humanity.

The tragedy of AI governance is that those with the greatest leverage to regulate AI have the least interest in doing so, while those with the greatest interest have the least leverage.

Resolving these challenges may require rethinking the incentive structures — or waiting for a crisis that brings the need for regulation and coordination into sharper focus.

##### **Plenary 6: Risk Management in Aviation**

**Mr Faris ISKANDAR**
<br>
Co-Founder, Aeroviation Singapore

In his speech on managing risk in aviation, Mr Iskandar will emphasise the critical importance of risk management not only within the aviation industry but also across various other sectors.

He will bring us through risk management key elements, which include Safety Culture, Communication &amp; Collaboration and Technology &amp; Innovation.

By incorporating the key elements into risk management practices, industries beyond aviation can enhance their resilience, minimise vulnerabilities, and foster a culture of safety and efficiency.

##### **Plenary 7: Your 3rd Party Suppliers Should Not Be Your Weakest Link**

**Mr HOI Wai Khin**
<br>
Partner, Technology Consulting, RSM Singapore
  
In the digital age, outsourcing enhances the backbone of organizational operations, providing critical hardware, software, and services that underpin digital infrastructure. However, when the weakest link in the chain is the 3rd party vendors, it exposes businesses to a spectrum of risks and vulnerabilities. This session delves into the intricacies of 3rd party supplier dependencies within organisational frameworks, examining the origins, consequences, and strategies for mitigating vulnerabilities.
