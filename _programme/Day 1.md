In his speech on managing risk in aviation, Faris Iskandar emphasizes the critical importance of risk management not only within the aviation industry but also across various other sectors.

Here are some key points that can be taken away by other industries:

**Safety Culture:** Faris stresses the need for a strong safety culture within organizations. This involves instilling a mindset where safety is prioritized above all else, fostering a proactive approach to risk identification and mitigation.

**Risk Assessment:** He highlights the significance of conducting thorough risk assessments regularly. This includes identifying potential hazards, evaluating their likelihood and potential impact, and implementing measures to mitigate risks effectively.

**Planning Ahead:** Faris emphasizes the importance in planning ahead and including back up plans if a situation does not go as planned

**Communication and Collaboration:** Effective communication and collaboration are essential in managing risks across industries. Faris encourages open dialogue, sharing of information, and collaboration between stakeholders to address risks collectively and efficiently.

**Technology and Innovation:** Leveraging technology and innovation can significantly enhance risk management practices. Faris discusses the importance of adopting advanced tools, such as data analytics, predictive modeling, and automation, to improve risk assessment and decision-making processes.

**Regulatory Compliance:** Adhering to regulatory requirements is fundamental in managing risks. Faris emphasizes the need for organizations to stay updated with industry regulations and standards, ensuring compliance to minimize legal and operational risks.

By incorporating these key points into their risk management practices, industries beyond aviation can enhance their resilience, minimize vulnerabilities, and foster a culture of safety and efficiency.
