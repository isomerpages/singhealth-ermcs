**Risk Assessment:** He highlights the significance of conducting thorough risk assessments regularly. This includes identifying potential hazards, evaluating their likelihood and potential impact, and implementing measures to mitigate risks effectively.

**Planning Ahead:** Faris emphasizes the importance in planning ahead and including back up plans if a situation does not go as planned

**Communication and Collaboration:** Effective communication and collaboration are essential in managing risks across industries. Faris encourages open dialogue, sharing of information, and collaboration between stakeholders to address risks collectively and efficiently.

This session aims to explore proactive approaches for mitigating vulnerabilities associated with managing 3rd party suppliers and enhancing resilience. It advocates for comprehensive supplier risk assessments, contractual agreements with stringent security provisions, and continuous monitoring of supplier performance and compliance.

In conclusion, this session emphasizes the critical imperative of fortifying supplier chains to safeguard against disruptions and ensure the resilience of digital ecosystems. It calls upon organizations to adopt a proactive and holistic approach to supplier management, integrating security considerations into procurement processes, and fostering strategic partnerships that prioritize resilience, innovation, and long-term viability.
